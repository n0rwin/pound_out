                <p>
                    I have to confess... <span class="highlight">I am a terrible designer.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I studied software engineering for 5 years, and I've been working in the field for the last 5 years.
                    I created quite a bit of code, some good, some bad.
                    I worked on the backend writing code that runs on servers, or communicates with some other pieces of software.
                    I spent some time working with databases.
                    AND I created user interfaces - web, fat client, reports - you name them.
                    One thing always bugged me - (nearly) every user interface I created looked awful to me.
                    Crude, blunt, like drawn by a 5 year old child.
                    Not polished or shiny, not fancy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't get me wrong, the things I created probably worked quite well, were sometimes useful and there are times when I am proud of what I created.
                    The customers often were quite happy with what I could deliver, nevertheless I always felt unhappy about my ugly user interfaces.
                </p>
                <p class="fill-in">I am not one of those people.</p>
                <p>
                    Recently I thought about it. There are people who are made to be designers.
                    They always have that special kind of view on things.
                    How to align things, how to structure and space elements, what colors to use.
                    Some of them take it a step further and think of user interaction and user experience to create stunning applications
                    that look and feel soooo nice and polished, so neat, tidy and stunning.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    I am not one of those people. I am not made to be a designer.
                    But you know what - if you aren't born talented you can still become good if not great in a field.
                    I remember hearing a story once about two famous bass players playing together. 
                    I don't remember who they were, probably Victor Wooten and Marcus Miller, maybe Jaco Pastorius - it doesn't matter for the story.
                    Each of the players were masters in what they did and each of them had his very own unique technique of playing.
                    They were jamming a bit together when they tried to teach each other their techniques.
                    And you know what - they were terrible at it. They couldn't do what the other player was doing - not by far.
                    It sounded like an absolute beginner was trying to play bass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So what can we learn from that? The two bass players in the story might be talented, but they did not get where they were without hard work.
                    Each of the players played and perfected his own technique over years and years of practicing and playing.
                </p>
                <p class="fill-in">I can become a designer too?</p>
                <p>
                    Yay - this means I can become a designer too, right?
                    Yes, I think so, but not without dedication and practicing.
                    And to be honest I don't know if I can do it, but at least I want to try!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So here's the deal.<br /> 
                    <span class="highlight">I challenge myself to practicing designing websites.</span><br/>
                    I will frequently create <span class="highlight">#OUT</span>s (pound outs) and these are the rules:
                </p>
                <ol class="rules">
                    <li>I will create a website (or <span class="highlight">#OUT</span> ) every week for 2018.</li>                
                    <li>I will publish each website after I created it.</li>
                    <li>Creating one website must not take me longer than 2 hours.</li>
                    <li>If I can't finish within 2 hours I must stop and publish the website anyway.</li>
                    <li>There are no limitations on tools. I can use any tool I want.</li>
                    <li>I must not use any code or template that was not created by myself previously.</li>
                    <li>I can however reuse things I created in previous <span class="highlight">#OUT</span>s.</li>
                    <li>I my also use content (text, images, videos,...) not created by me as long as I do not violate any copyrights.</li>
                    <li>Apart from that the whole website including content, structure and styling has to be created within 2 hours.</li>
                    <li>There are also no limitations on technologies (HTML, PHP, ASP.NET, Angular, React, ...) as long as the result is a website visible in a browser.</li>
                    <li>Once I finished working on a <span class="highlight">#OUT</span> I must not alter it afterwards.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The site you are looking at right now is my first #OUT.
                    I started the timer about 45 minutes ago and just wrote all the text.
                    I will start working on the design right afterwards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you stumble upon this website and have a look at my #OUTs I would greatly appreciate any feedback.
                    So feel free to send me a mail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the future I also want to publish all the code for my #OUTs.
                    But let's start simple first :)
